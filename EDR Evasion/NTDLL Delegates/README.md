During some tool developments I've found myself unsuccessfully trying to create C# delegates to execute direct syscalls in x64 windows environments. Since these are undocumented functions, some delegates may be pretty hard to obtain. Threfore, I decided to collect all the working delegates and structs required to call some NTDLL.dll exported functions in a single repository. I'll keep updating this repo in order to add more functions. Please let me know if you have found a delegate that doesn't exist already in the repository so I can add it!
